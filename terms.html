                <p>Welcome to Wave. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Wave website and its services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

                <p>Wave is a free-to-use directory and player for publicly available Philippine radio streams. The Service provides links to third-party content but does not host, control, or distribute any audio content itself. We act solely as a directory to help users discover and listen to live radio.</p>

                <h2>2. User Conduct and Responsibilities</h2>

                <p>All trademarks, logos, station names, and audio streams are the property of their respective owners. Wave claims no ownership or rights over such content. The Service is an index of content that is already publicly accessible on the internet. If you are a copyright owner and believe that content accessible through our Service infringes your rights, please contact the responsible third-party station or content host.</p>

                <h2>4. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We do not guarantee the availability, accuracy, legality, or quality of any stream. We do not warrant that the service will be uninterrupted or error-free.</p>
                <p>In no event shall Wave, its owners, or affiliates be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Service.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>5. Modification of Service</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service (or any part of it) at any time, with or without notice. You agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Service.</p>
