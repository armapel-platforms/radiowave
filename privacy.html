                <p>Wave ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the Wave website (the "Service"). Your privacy is critically important to us.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>1. No Personal Information Collected</h2>
                <p>We believe in privacy by design. The Service is built to be used without requiring any personally identifiable information (PII) from you. We do not have a user registration, login, or sign-up system. Therefore, we do not collect, store, process, or share any personal data such as your name or email address.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>2. Anonymous Usage Data</h2>
                <p>To improve the Service, we may use privacy-friendly analytics to collect anonymous, aggregated, non-personal information. This may include your browser type, country, and pages visited. This data is used for statistical analysis of traffic only and cannot be used to identify any individual user.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>3. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
                <p>Wave does not use cookies for user tracking or advertising. The Service may use the local storage on your device for essential functional purposes, such as remembering your volume preference for the audio player. This data is stored only on your browser and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>4. Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
                <p>The core function of our Service is to connect to third-party radio station streams. When you play a station, you are interacting with audio content served from these third parties. We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external services.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
                <p>While we do not collect personal information, we take reasonable measures to protect the integrity of our Service. The site uses HTTPS to ensure that your connection to our servers is encrypted.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Our Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with information, we will take steps to delete it.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
